# Simplified-bubble-quiz

This is a simplified version of a quiz I created for my dissertation. Users of the quiz will answer questions to see how well they know the British public, and will recieve a score at the end. The aim of the quiz was to assess whether social media bubbles existed, and if so how strong they can be.

## Instructions

Select your own answer to the question, along with using the sliders to predict what you think the percentage of the public selected each answer. Upon completing the quiz, you will be presented with your score and also your answers compared to the actual ones. You'll then have a chance to give your own feedback.
